            Last updated on Nov 20th 2023 Extrovert believes in helping its
            customers as far as possible, and has therefore a liberal
            cancellation policy. Under this policy: Cancellations will be
            considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the
            order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if
            the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they
            have initiated the process of shipping them. Extrovert does not
            accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers,
            eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the
            customer establishes that the quality of product delivered is not
            good. In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report
            the same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be
            entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at
            his own end. This should be reported within of receipt of the
            products. In case you feel that the product received is not as shown
            on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the
            notice of our customer service within of receiving the product. The
            Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an
            appropriate decision. In case of complaints regarding products that
            come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue to
            them. In case of any Refunds approved by the Extrovert, itâ€™ll take
            for the refund to be processed to the end customer.
